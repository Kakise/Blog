Then access `/admin/` in your website to make changes according to your needs. Remove the precedent posts, pages etc... mess up with the different configuration files and enjoy ! :)

# Usage
An icon pack that includes fontawesome ones was included with the cms. Use them for the social menu or for your posts by using `<i class="icon-name"></i>` in your post.

Looking for the "My Anime List" icon? I made it myself using gravit. You'll find it here: <https://kakise.me/images/MyAnimeListIcon.gvdesign>
